Customer Churn Prediction Using Random Forest
This project demonstrates the prediction of customer churn using the Random Forest algorithm.
The model utilizes the Customer Churn dataset to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay with a company based on various features such as customer demographics, account information, and service usage.

Overview:
In this project, we utilize a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a customer will churn based on the provided dataset. The goal is to understand how various features (such as customer tenure, service usage, and demographics) impact the likelihood of customer churn and build a reliable predictive model.

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features for the model.
Model Training: Training a Random Forest classifier on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a collection of information about customers from a telecommunications company. The dataset includes several features that describe customer attributes and their usage patterns, such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Tenure: Duration the customer has been with the company (in years).
ServiceUsage: The extent of the customerâ€™s service usage.
Churn: Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or stayed (0).
