Car Evaluation using Random Forest Classifier

Overview:
This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier to predict the quality and evaluation of cars based on various features. The dataset consists of multiple attributes describing cars, such as their buying price, maintenance cost, safety, and other characteristics. The goal is to classify cars into categories based on their evaluation, helping to assess whether a car is highly recommended, recommended, or not recommended.

Objective:
•	Goal: Classify cars based on their features such as price, maintenance, safety, and other attributes into different evaluation categories.
•	Model: Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model and predict the car evaluation based on the features.
•	Dataset: The project uses the Car Evaluation dataset to perform the classification task.
•	Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset:
The Car Evaluation dataset contains information about cars' features and their evaluation categories. The target variable is class, which indicates the car's evaluation.

Features:
•	buying: Buying price of the car (categorical: low, med, high, vhigh).
•	maint: Maintenance price of the car (categorical: low, med, high, vhigh).
•	doors: Number of doors (categorical: 2, 3, 4, 5more).
•	persons: Capacity in terms of persons (categorical: 2, 4, more).
•	lug_boot: Size of the luggage boot (categorical: small, med, big).
•	safety: Safety of the car (categorical: low, med, high).
•	class: The evaluation class of the car (target variable, categorical: unacc, acc, good, vgood).

The target variable (class) represents the car evaluation, with the following possible values:
•	unacc: Unacceptable
•	acc: Acceptable
•	good: Good
•	vgood: Very Good

How It Works:
A Random Forest model is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. For classification tasks, it combines the outputs of many individual decision trees to make the final decision.
1.	Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features (e.g., using one-hot encoding), and prepare the data for training.
2.	Model Training: Train a Random Forest model using the preprocessed data.
3.	Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using various classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4.	Feature Importance: Random Forest can also provide insights into which features are most important in predicting car evaluations
